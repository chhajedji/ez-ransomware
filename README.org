* Ransomware

A ransomware is a piece of code that encrypts files and denies user
access. The files can only be decrypted with the key used while encryption.

In this project, Python's ~Fernet~ module is used to generate keys,
encrypt, and decrypt files.

[[./encrypt.py][encrypt.py]] first generates a /key/ (key.key file).  This is being done
by ~Fernet.generate_key()~. The key.key file stores the key which will
be used to encrypt and further decrypt files. ~encrypt.py~ recursively
iterates and encrypts all the files present in the ~root_dir~. During
encryption, we need to make sure that we are not encrypting the keys
or the script used for encryption, or else that might have not end up
well.


[[./decrypt.py][decrypt.py]] iterates through files similar to encrypt.py. Just the
difference is that instead of encrypting, it decrypts all the files
using same key which was generated during encryption. Without that
key, decryption wouldn't work.


For recursively iterating files during encryption and decryption,
[[https://github.com/chhajedji/simple-snippets/tree/master/Python/filelister][FileLister]] is being used, which is just simple recursive way of
listing all the files in a given directory.


** Usage

For encryption, either give no arguments to run throughout ~test_dir~
or give specific path:

[[test_dir/img/one.png]]

For specific set of files:
[[./test_dir/img/two.png]]


Decryption:

[[./test_dir/img/three.png]]

For specific set of files:
[[./test_dir/img/four.png]]
